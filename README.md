# End-to-End Data Science Project: Comprehensive Workflow

Welcome to the **End-to-End Data Science Project: Comprehensive Workflow** repository. This project demonstrates a structured approach to implementing, validating, and deploying machine learning solutions, showcasing expertise in all stages of the data science lifecycle.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to walk through the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and importing data from various sources.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensuring data quality and integrity through validation checks.
3. **Data Transformation**: Processing and transforming raw data into suitable formats for modeling.
4. **Model Training**: Developing and training machine learning models using processed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for real-world applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines.
- `artifacts/`: Stores generated artifacts such as trained models and preprocessing objects.
- `config/`: Includes configuration files for various stages of the project.
- `logs/`: Houses log files to track the execution flow and debug information.
- `research/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks and exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts.
- `src/datascience/`: Main source code for data ingestion, validation, transformation, and modeling.
- `templates/`: Includes template files for consistent project structure.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the project environment.
- `LICENSE`: Details the licensing information for the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and documentation of the project.
- `app.py`: Flask application for model deployment.
- `main.py`: Entry point for executing the data science pipeline.
- `params.yaml`: Holds parameter configurations for various components.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `schema.yaml`: Defines the data schema for validation purposes.
- `setup.py`: Script for packaging and installing the project.
- `template.py`: Template script for consistent code structure.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component of the data science pipeline is modularized for clarity and reusability.
- **Configuration Management**: Utilizes YAML files (`config.yaml`, `params.yaml`, `schema.yaml`) for easy configuration and parameter tuning.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
- **Docker Integration**: A `Dockerfile` is provided to create a consistent and reproducible environment for the project.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows are set up to ensure code quality and automate testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udaybhaskar717/End-to-End-DataScienceProject.git
   cd End-to-End-DataScienceProject
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure the Project**:
   - Update the `config.yaml`, `params.yaml`, and `schema.yaml` files as needed to match your data and requirements.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Execute the main pipeline script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

5. **Deploy the Model**:
   - Use `app.py` to deploy the trained model as a Flask application:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
